**Performance Optimization of Solar Panels**

As solar energy systems become increasingly popular in sustainable energy infrastructures, maintaining high performance and reducing downtime are essential. Traditional maintenance methods for photovoltaic (PV) systems are often reactive, leading to energy loss and increased costs.

This project aims to develop a Machine Learning model that predicts performance degradation and potential failures in solar panels using historical and real-time sensor data, enabling predictive maintenance and optimal energy output.

**Features**

- **Predictive Maintenance:** Anticipate failures and degradation before they impact energy production.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Analyze historical and real-time sensor data for informed decision-making.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Apply advanced ML techniques for accurate predictions.
- **Energy Optimization:** Maximize energy output by proactively addressing issues.
